    <h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is a computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm as a function of the length of the input. It is crucial for evaluating the efficiency of algorithms.</p>
    
    <p>Space Complexity, on the other hand, refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to run as a function of the input size. Itâ€™s often expressed in terms of Big O notation, such as <b>Space Complexity</b> is O(n) for linear space usage.</p>
