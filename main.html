    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete based on the length of the input. An efficient algorithm aims to minimize time complexity.</p>
    
    <p>Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to run as a function of the input size. For example, an algorithm with <b>Space Complexity</b> of O(n) requires memory that grows linearly with the input size.</p>
